# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Thumbs up on including that planning folder, but I do not see a README. As your projects grow more complex, it is essential to include these so that I (or a potential employer) know what your project is all about and how to go about installing it locally. Let me know when you add this and I'll be happy to take a look.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. While your project technically does meet the technical requirements, I would really like to see you implement create and update functionality for your Book and Bookshelf models. As it stands, your project does not allow the user to add/update either of those models. Please let me know if you would like any help implementing this. This is an important thing to hammer down before we move too far from Rails.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Solid job here. Ways to improve here are (1) be consistent with indentation and (2) remove commented-out code from your master branch. Also, please look at my inline code comments via the link below.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. While you met the technical requirements, there are some important features you need to implement in your application. Please take a look at my inline code comments as well as my notes in the `Technical Requirements` portion of this evaluation. Happy to answer any questions you might have, or even pair on this if you'd like.
